      - `Customer(CustomerID, Name, State)`
    - **Summary:** Relational operations across different columns leverage indexes on both customer location and transaction amount.

11. **Query:** Retrieve the birthday list of employees for the upcoming month.
    - **Schema:**
      - `Employee(EmployeeID, Name, BirthDate)`
    - **Summary:** Date operations are handled optimally with the use of relational databases’ date functions.

12. **Query:** Show all courses that do not have any enrolled students.
    - **Schema:**
      - `Course(CourseID, CourseName)`
      - `Enrollment(StudentID, CourseID)`
    - **Summary:** Employs a `NOT IN` or `LEFT JOIN` to find non-enforced entries, a strength of relational logic.

13. **Query:** Get the average rating of all movies directed by 'Steven Spielberg'.
    - **Schema:**
      - `Director(DirectorID, Name)`
      - `Movie(MovieID, Title, DirectorID, Rating)`
    - **Summary:** Designed for efficient aggregation and filtering, indexing on director names can reduce computational overhead.

14. **Query:** List customers who have placed more than 50 orders.
    - **Schema:**
      - `Customer(CustomerID, Name)`
      - `Order(OrderID, CustomerID)`
    - **Summary:** A combination of aggregation and having clause capitalizes on relational databases’ deft handling of summarization tasks.

15. **Query:** Display all active employees sorted by their hire date.
    - **Schema:**
      - `Employee(EmployeeID, Name, HireDate, Status)`

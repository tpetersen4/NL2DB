Below are 40 natural language queries suitable for Relational Databases, along with a normalized schema and explanations for each:

### 1. Query: 
**"List all customers who have made purchases over $1,000 last month."**

- **Schema in 3NF:**
  - Customer(CustID, Name, Email, Phone)
  - Order(OrderID, CustID, OrderDate, OrderTotal)
  
- **Summary:** Relational databases excel at filtering and aggregating data using SQL, where operations such as summation can be efficiently executed, especially with properly indexed fields.

### 2. Query: 
**"Retrieve the top 5 selling products last quarter."**

- **Schema in 3NF:**
  - Product(ProductID, Name, Price)
  - Sales(SaleID, ProductID, Quantity, SaleDate)
  
- **Summary:** With relational databases, joins and aggregations such as the `SUM` function can be efficiently used to compute total sales and identify top performers over specific periods.

### 3. Query: 
**"Find employees who have not submitted their timesheets for last week."**

- **Schema in 3NF:**
  - Employee(EmpID, Name, DeptID)
  - Timesheet(TimesheetID, EmpID, WeekStartDate, Submitted)

- **Summary:** Relational databases can efficiently use `JOIN` and `NOT EXISTS` clauses to identify missing records in associated tables.

### 4. Query:
**"Show courses that have not been enrolled by any student."**

- **Schema in 3NF:**
  - Course(CourseID, Title, Description)
  - Enrollment(StudentID, CourseID)

- **Summary:** Utilizing left joins and filtering (`WHERE` clause) in relational databases enables quick trimming of non-matching records.

### 5. Query:
**"List all departments and the number of employees in each."**

- **Schema in 3NF:**
  - Department(DeptID, DeptName)
  - Employee(EmpID, Name, DeptID)

- **Summary:** Grouping and counting (`GROUP BY` and `COUNT`) are strengths of SQL, processed quickly using indexed relations.

### 6. Query:
**"Who are the vendors supplying more than 3 products?"**

- **Schema in 3NF:**
  - Vendor(VendorID, Name, ContactInfo)
  - Product(ProductID, VendorID, Name, Category)

- **Summary:** Efficient multi-table queries can easily be executed through the use of aggregate functions alongside `HAVING` clauses.

### 7. Query:
**"Find all orders that include a specific product."**

- **Schema in 3NF:**
  - Order(OrderID, CustID, OrderDate)
  - OrderDetail(OrderDetailID, OrderID, ProductID, Quantity)
  - Product(ProductID, Name)

- **Summary:** Complex queries across multiple tables are executed effectively, showcasing the relational model's robustness in maintaining integrity.

### 8. Query:
**"Retrieve students with a GPA higher than 3.5."**

- **Schema in 3NF:**
  - Student(StudentID, Name, GPA)

- **Summary:** Simple conditional queries are processed very efficiently using proper indexing in relational databases.

### 9. Query:
**"Display all invoices generated in the last 7 days."**

- **Schema in 3NF:**
  - Invoice(InvoiceID, CustID, InvoiceDate, Total)
  - Customer(CustID, Name, Email)

- **Summary:** Date-based queries take advantage of relational databases' optimized functions and manageable indexing strategies.

### 10. Query:
**"List all books that have never been borrowed and are published after 2010."**

- **Schema in 3NF:**
  - Book(BookID, Title, PubYear)
  - Loan(LoanID, BookID, BorrowDate)

- **Summary:** Combination of filtering by non-existent foreign references and conditional statements works seamlessly in an RDBMS.

### 11. Query:
**"Get the details of the oldest car from the available inventory."**

- **Schema in 3NF:**
  - Car(CarID, Make, Model, Year)
  - InventoryItem(ItemID, CarID, InventoryDate)

- **Summary:** Aggregates and sorting can be efficiently performed, providing optimal solutions to find max/min statistical values.

### 12. Query:
**"Find which movies were watched the most in the current month."**

- **Schema in 3NF:**
  - Movie(MovieID, Title, Genre)
  - WatchRecord(UserID, MovieID, WatchDate)

- **Summary:** Time-bound aggregation filters swiftly in RDBMS, tapping into the efficiency of indexes and computed ranks.

### 13. Query:
**"Which employees have been promoted within the last year?"**

- **Schema in 3NF:**
  - Employee(EmpID, Name, HireDate, DeptID)
  - Promotion(PromotionID, EmpID, PromotionDate, NewTitle)

- **Summary:** Historical records and timestamps are handled efficiently using SQL's date manipulation capabilities.

### 14. Query:
**"List customers who have ordered more than 5 times."**

- **Schema in 3NF:**
  - Customer(CustID, Name, Email)
  - Order(OrderID, CustID, OrderDate)

- **Summary:** Aggregation and `HAVING` clauses enable easy counting of subordinate records.

### 15. Query:
**"Retrieve the list of books available in the library by a certain author."**

- **Schema in 3NF:**

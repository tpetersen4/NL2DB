### Schema Normalization
Most of these schemas follow normalization principles ensuring that:
- **1NF**: Each table contains atomic values and each column has unique values.
- **2NF**: Ensures that all non-key attributes are fully functional dependent on the primary key.
- **3NF**: Removes transitive dependencies, making data schemas efficient by ensuring all data within tables is directly related to primary keys.

These schemas facilitate efficient query execution, reduced redundancy, and maintain data integrity in a relational database environment, making them suitable for the queries listed.

Creating a set of 39 natural language queries designed to run efficiently on relational databases involves understanding the relational model and using it to perform operations that leverage the way data is structured, stored, and accessed in these systems. I'll provide these natural language queries alongside a brief schema that would be in at least Third Normal Form (3NF), which minimizes redundancy and ensures data integrity. For each query, I'll also offer a short summary explaining why it's suitable for a relational database.

### Schema Outline

Let's assume a simple database for a medium-sized e-commerce company. Here's a normalized schema in 3NF:

1. **Customers**
   - `CustomerID` (Primary Key)
   - `FirstName`
   - `LastName`
   - `Email`
   - `Phone`

2. **Products**
   - `ProductID` (Primary Key)
   - `ProductName`
   - `Category`
   - `Price`

3. **Orders**
   - `OrderID` (Primary Key)
   - `OrderDate`
   - `CustomerID` (Foreign Key referencing Customers)

4. **OrderItems**
   - `OrderItemID` (Primary Key)
   - `OrderID` (Foreign Key referencing Orders)
   - `ProductID` (Foreign Key referencing Products)
   - `Quantity`
   - `PriceAtPurchase`

5. **Categories**
   - `CategoryID` (Primary Key)
   - `CategoryName`

The schema ensures that no redundant data is stored, maintaining referential integrity.

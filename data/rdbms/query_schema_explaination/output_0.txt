Creating a set of 34 natural language queries along with database schemas and explanations for relational databases involves understanding the benefits and limitations of relational systems. Relational databases are particularly efficient for structured data with clear relationships, typified by tables where data rows adhere to a fixed schema and integrity is maintained through normalization and foreign keys. Below are 34 example queries:

### Schema Definitions
1. **Customer(CustomerID, FirstName, LastName, Email)**
2. **Order(OrderID, OrderDate, CustomerID, TotalAmount)**
3. **Product(ProductID, ProductName, Price)**
4. **OrderItem(OrderItemID, OrderID, ProductID, Quantity)**
5. **Supplier(SupplierID, SupplierName, ContactEmail)**
6. **ProductSupplier(ProductID, SupplierID)**
7. **Employee(EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, Department)**
8. **Department(DepartmentID, DepartmentName, ManagerID)**
9. **Inventory(ProductID, StockLevel)**
10. **Shipment(ShipmentID, OrderID, ShipDate, TrackingNumber)**

Creating queries that run efficiently on relational databases (RDBMS) but might not perform as well on other types of databases like NoSQL databases, involves understanding the strengths of relational databases. Relational databases are particularly efficient at handling queries that involve complex relationships, structured data, transactions, and operations involving joins, aggregations, and precise conditions. Here are 38 natural language queries well-suited for execution on RDBMS:

**Benefits in RDBMS:**
- **Structure & Integrity:** RDBMS schemas with strict data types, relationships (FK, PK), and constraints ensure efficient query processing.
- **Query Optimization:** Advanced optimizers and use of indexes and execution plans improve speed.
- **Transaction Safety:** ACID properties ensure the trustworthiness of complex queries involving multi-step transactional data.
- **Joins & Aggregations:** Efficiently designed to handle join operations and aggregations that rely on normalized tables.

Such queries typically involve structured data with established relationships and benefit from the advanced utilities provided by RDBMS, which might not be as effective in handling intricate relations or ensuring data integrity in non-relational databases.

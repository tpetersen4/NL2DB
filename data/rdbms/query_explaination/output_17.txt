When designing queries that are efficiently executed on relational databases but might present challenges for other types of databases, we are typically leveraging the strengths of SQL query optimization, complex joins, aggregations, and indexing capabilities that RDBMSs offer. Complex queries often involve multiple conditions, aggregations, or joins, which can be less efficient on non-relational databases, particularly those that struggle with advanced querying or lack SQL optimizations.

Here are 38 natural language queries that fit this criterion:

These queries would particularly run efficiently on relational databases due to their ability to handle complex joins, leverage tuned indexing strategies, apply powerful aggregations, and optimize performance through sophisticated query planning. Other databases might struggle due to limitations in handling multiple related datasets, lack of comparable indexing capabilities, or difficulty in optimizing complex logical operations and conditional query constructs.

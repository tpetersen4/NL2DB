 Select employee salary evolution over five years.,      Relational databases support schema evolution with history tracking better than many NoSQL databases.,rdbms
" Generate a report of sales by region, product, and quarter.",      Relational databases are designed for multidimensional data analysis using OLAP operations.,rdbms
 Normalize a list of products and their suppliers into separate tables.,"      Relational systems apply normalization principles natively, leading to efficient storage and access.",rdbms
 Find employees eligible for a bonus based on performance and tenure conditions.,      SQL's rich set of functions for conditional logic outperforms many NoSQL query languages.,rdbms
 Show changes made to employee data over time.,      Relational databases support historical tracking using date-stamping and robust logging mechanisms.,rdbms
 Fetch user roles and permissions from a centralized table structure.,      Relational databases efficiently manage security constraints via relational integrity.,rdbms
 Identify financial transactions that exceed reporting limits.,      Relational systems are preferred for compliance due to strong integrity constraints.,rdbms
 Ensure no duplicate entries in employee records without unique email or ID.,      Relational databases reduce redundancy and anomalies through normalization.,rdbms
 List employees in order of hire dates.,      Efficient ordering and indexing available in relational models.,rdbms
 Identify user segments for targeted marketing based on purchase patterns.,      Efficient use of indexes and complex conditions filtering.,rdbms

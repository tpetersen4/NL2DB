       Aggregation and count queries are easily manageable in SQL.

25. **Find the average order size per customer.**
       Relational databases efficiently handle averages through grouped calculations.

26. **Identify the last purchase date for every active customer.**
       Relational databases are effective at retrieving latest records using `MAX()` functions.

27. **Generate a list of all active subscriptions and their renewal dates.**
       Combining current status with future dates via filtering is straightforward in SQL.

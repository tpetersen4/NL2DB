### Why Relational Databases are Efficient for These Queries

**Structured Data and Schema Design:** These queries involve high volumes of transactional data, often with a fixed schema, which fits well into relational databases that use tables to structure data efficiently.

**Complex Joins and Aggregates:** Queries that involve joining multiple tables to pull related data or those that use aggregated functions (such as averages, maximums, and minimums) are well-suited to RDBMS systems because they are designed to optimize such operations with SQL.

**Transaction Support:** Relational databases offer strong transaction management and concurrency control, important for maintaining consistency and integrity in multistep and multifaceted queries.

**Indexing Capabilities:** Relational databases use indexing systems effectively to enhance query performance, allowing them to swiftly locate and retrieve data even in the case of complex queries.

**Analytical Processing:** Many relational systems now include OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) extensions that support complex analytical queries efficiently.

**Scalability and Optimization:** Although alternative databases are growing more capable, relational databases still reliably provide optimization features and scalability for heavily transactional workloads. 

**Consistency and Reliability:** With ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties, relational systems are well-suited for scenarios where data reliability is paramount, ensuring that complex queries return accurate, timely results.

Relational databases thus remain highly efficient and reliable for executing complex queries that demand structured interactions across substantial volumes of interconnected data.

Non-relational databases, such as NoSQL databases, are designed to handle large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data and are highly scalable, making them suitable for certain types of complex queries that can be cumbersome in traditional relational databases (RDBMS). NoSQL databases like MongoDB, Cassandra, or DynamoDB often excel in scenarios involving large datasets where the schema may evolve over time, high-velocity data, and complex, hierarchical, or nested data structures.

Here are 35 complex queries that might run more efficiently on NoSQL databases due to their flexible schema, ability to handle large volumes of data, and built-in features for dealing with unstructured data:

### Why These Queries Are Efficient in NoSQL:
- **Schema Flexibility**: NoSQL databases can handle evolving data models gracefully. This is beneficial when working with complex queries that involve unstructured or nested data.
- **Horizontal Scalability**: NoSQL systems distribute data across multiple servers, handling large volumes of data efficiently and providing high availability.
- **Handling of High-Velocity Data**: NoSQL databases are designed to handle high-speed reads and writes with ease, which is crucial for real-time queries involving large data sets.
- **Data Denormalization**: The ability to store related data together in a non-relational database reduces the need for complex joins, which are costly in terms of performance in RDBMS.
- **Rich Querying**: Many NoSQL databases support powerful, flexible querying methods, including map-reduce operations, aggregations, and full-text search capabilities, which often outpace traditional SQL for complex, heterogeneous datasets.

While traditional databases like SQL can perform these tasks, they may encounter performance bottlenecks due to the need for complex joins, the rigidity of schemas, and limitations in handling distributed, unstructured data efficiently.

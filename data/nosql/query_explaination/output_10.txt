### Explanation

In these queries, NoSQL databases excel due to their:

- **Flexibility in Handling Unstructured Data**: NoSQL can efficiently manage unstructured or semi-structured data, such as JSON or XML, allowing easy storage and querying of data without fixed schema constraints. This is particularly beneficial for dynamic data captured from diverse sources like social media, IoT devices, or logs.

- **Horizontal Scalability**: Distributed architecture allows NoSQL systems to handle massive volumes of data, perfect for large-scale applications requiring real-time analytics across multiple data nodes without the limitations imposed by SQL joins.

- **Schema-less Design**: The absence of a fixed schema in NoSQL makes it possible to accommodate increasingly diverse data points and complex queries without needing the costly and time-consuming schema migrations typically necessary in RDBMS.

- **Document-based Data Model**: In document-oriented NoSQL databases like MongoDB, complex nested structures can be retained within single records, which aligns well with hierarchical or nested query logic, reducing the need for multiple table joins.

- **Operational Speed**: Due to denormalization and efficient indexing, read-heavy operations can often be done faster in NoSQL, especially when collating data from vast pools with flexible query execution policies. 

Thus, these types of queries may suffer performance issues and complexity constraints within traditional relational databases, which rely on defined schema models and are less suited for handling unstructured data at scale.
